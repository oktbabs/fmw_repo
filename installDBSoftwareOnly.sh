Configure Tuned as described in House of Brickâ€™s blog post (Tuned is installed by default on RHEL7).
At this point, we are ready to begin the initial software installation. As the downloaded file was unzipped, a directory called database was created under your current directory.

Cd to the ./database/response directory.
Copy the db_install.rsp file to the ./database directory. In my case, it will be copied from /home/oracle/database/response directory to /home/oracle/database
Modify the following lines (only) to read as follows (or customize for your environment) in the file /home/oracle/database/db_install.rsp:
oracle.install.option=INSTALL_DB_SWONLY
 UNIX_GROUP_NAME=oinstall
 INVENTORY_LOCATION=/u01/app/oraInventory
 ORACLE_HOME=/u01/app/oracle/product/12.2.0.1/dbhome_1
 ORACLE_BASE=/u01/app/oracle
 oracle.install.db.InstallEdition=EE
 oracle.install.db.OSDBA_GROUP=dba
 oracle.install.db.OSOPER_GROUP=dba
 oracle.install.db.OSBACKUPDBA_GROUP=dba
 oracle.install.db.OSDGDBA_GROUP=dba
 oracle.install.db.OSKMDBA_GROUP=dba
 oracle.install.db.OSRACDBA_GROUP=dba
 oracle.install.db.OSRACDBA_GROUP=dba
 SECURITY_UPDATES_VIA_MYORACLESUPPORT=false
 DECLINE_SECURITY_UPDATES=true
 

After making the changes to the db_install.rsp file, you are ready to run the Oracle installation. The command to run the Oracle home in silent mode (running from the database directory) is:
./runInstaller -silent -responseFile
/home/oracle/database/db_install.rsp
